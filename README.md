# OnlineBudgetingTool
Online Budgeting Tool that will allow users to manage their expenses more effectively.

Purpose of the software

The main purpose of the online budgeting tool is to provide users with a convenient and efficient way to manage their expenses. The tool will allow users to input their expenses, set budgets, and view expense reports in a simple and easy-to-use interface. The proposed system will be developed using C#, with a React.js frontend, and will be hosted on the Microsoft Azure cloud platform with their free tier.

Functional requirements

The online budgeting tool will provide the following functionality:

•	Input: Users will be able to input their expenses into the system, including the amount, category, and date. They will also be able to upload supporting documents, such as receipts.

•	Processing: The system will process the input data and generate expense reports.

•	Output: Users will be able to view their expense reports in a simple and easy-to-use interface. They will also be able to download their expense reports in PDF format for offline viewing.

Relevant literature

Some of the relevant literature that will assist in completing this project includes:

•	"The Psychology of Money" by Morgan Housel

•	"The Simple Path to Wealth" by JL Collins

•	"Your Money or Your Life" by Vicki Robin and Joe Dominguez

Similar software 

There are many expenses management and budgeting tools available on the market, such as Mint, Personal Capital, and YNAB. These tools offer similar functionality to the proposed online budgeting tool, but they are not tailored to the specific needs of the target users.

Project plan

The project will be completed in several phases:

•	Phase 1: Design and planning. This phase will involve designing the overall system architecture and user interface, as well as creating a detailed project plan.

•	Phase 2: Development. This phase will involve developing the backend and frontend of the system, including the database and API.

•	Phase 3: Testing. This phase will involve testing the system to ensure that it meets the functional requirements and performs correctly.

•	Phase 4: Deployment. This phase will involve deploying the system to the Microsoft Azure cloud platform with their free tier.

Data Storage and technology

The online budgeting tool will store the following data:

•	Users personal information (username, password, email)

•	Users financial data (expenses, budgets)

•	Users financial reports (expense reports)

The data will be collected by the user through the web application and stored in an SQLite database. SQLite is a lightweight, file-based database engine that is easy to use and requires minimal setup and maintenance, making it a suitable choice for this project.
The data stored in the system will be used to generate expense reports and provide users with personalized financial recommendations based on their spending patterns.

Conclusion

This project proposal outlines a plan for developing a simple and easy-to-use online budgeting tool that will allow users to manage their expenses more effectively. The proposed system will be developed using C#, with a React.js frontend, and will be hosted on the Microsoft Azure cloud platform with their free tier. The system will store the data in an SQLite database, providing a simple and easy-to-use solution for data storage. The proposed system will provide users with the functionality they need to track their expenses, set budgets, and view expense reports in a simple and easy-to-use interface. By using a lightweight and file-based database engine, the system will be easy to set up and maintain, and the use of Azure cloud platform will ensure that the system can be easily deployed and scaled as needed. Overall, this project aims to provide a valuable tool to help users manage their expenses and reach their financial goals.
